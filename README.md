# Overview
This repository contains my work to better understand and apply reinforcement learning algorithms. The main purpose is for my own improvement and as a personal reference for future review of the material. The secondary purpose of this repository--and the reason it is made public--is to serve as a reference of my coding capabilities and style to recruiters and prospective clients.

This repository generally follows the [Artificial Intelligence: Reinforcement Learning in Python](https://deeplearningcourses.com/c/artificial-intelligence-reinforcement-learning-in-python) course developed by the Lazy Programmer, however all notes and code are my own thoughts and work. It is not my intent to duplicate, supplant or replace the course, and my only objective in making the repository public is for the purposes stated above.

## License

## Structure
I enjoy writing robust, well documented and tested code that is reproduceable and runs well in production. However, since this repository is not intended for production systems, I do not spend a lot of time writting tests, nor have I implemented Docker images, containerization, and Dev environments. I do however implement other programming practices honed over 7+ years in Data Science (as of 2023). Such as:

* Virtual python environment managed by [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)
* Python installation managed by [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv)
* Python packages for easy installation into other projects.
* Separation of production and exploration code (notebook folder)
* Git ignore files for cleaner repositories and credential protection
* Extensive documentation of the project, modules, and code.

    2. Pyenv Version file
    3. Poetry Files
    4. Readme

# Caveats
Since my objective is to reinforce my understanding of these algorithms and techniques, you are going to find problems and issues in my code. This will be especially true if you take the time to review the git commit history. These are on full display for my own benefit as I work through issues, identify fixes, improve my understanding, etc. I'm a realist and believe the only way I can plot a path to future success is to know where I've been and where I currently am. If you are reading this then I hope you will view this display of my past/current weakness as a demonstration of my genuine desire to grow and improve, my honesty and humility, and as a demonstration of my problem solving abilities.

Thanks again for checking out my work!
